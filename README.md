# The Stormlight Archive Character Network

This project aims to extract relationships between The Stormlight Archive's characters from the books. The character names and their ethnicity were extracted through a web scraping process from the Coppermind wiki using selenium. I created a Network with their relationships and performed graph analysis techniques such as centrality measures and community detection using NetworkX library. I also visualized the resulting network using Pyvis library.
